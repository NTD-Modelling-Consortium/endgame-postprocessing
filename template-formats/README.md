# Template Formats

Each folder represents on standardised format in the pipeline:

* standarised-model-output: what all models should produce to be fed into this pipeline
* prevalance-visualisation-format: the output of this pipeline that can be used to produce the prevalance visualisations

In the formats there is also definition files for the measures. Any measure that can appear in the output 
should be documented here. 

Long term - the values can be validated, perhaps even having a schema for the directory structure, the csv
structure and the types of the columns to reduce errors.
